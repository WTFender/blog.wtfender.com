## Prelude (from a human)

I used GitHub CoPilot to change the theme on this blog. I picked out a hugo theme, downloaded it, and then used CoPilot chat to do the rest of the work. When the changes were finished, I asked CoPilot...

> Using my git history, chat history, and any other timeline you can see - can you help me create a file with a summary of all the changes we've made over the last 3 days?

Below is the markdown file (blog post) that CoPilot created summarizing the work.

## Overview

Over the last three days, the WTFender blog underwent a complete transformation. What started as a simple theme switch evolved into a comprehensive redesign featuring custom styling, advanced functionality, and a significantly improved user experience.

This post documents the journey from a basic Hugo site to a highly customized, feature-rich platform.

## Major Changes

### Theme Migration and Setup
**Two days ago** - The foundation was laid with a complete theme overhaul:

- **Switched from Terminal theme to Stack theme**
- Added complete Stack theme implementation with extensive customization  
- Updated Hugo configuration for new theme compatibility
- Implemented GitHub Actions deployment workflow updates

The Stack theme provided a solid foundation with better widget support and more flexible layout options compared to the previous Terminal theme.

### Custom Styling Revolution
**Yesterday** - The visual transformation began with extensive CSS customizations:

- **Created 1,336 lines of custom CSS** in `assets/scss/custom.scss`
- Implemented a custom **blue and purple color scheme**
- Enhanced sidebar styling and layout with left-aligned menu items
- Developed beveled badge styling for tags and categories

#### Color System
The new design centers around a carefully chosen color palette:
- **Primary Blue**: `#23B0FF` - Used for links, accents, and primary actions
- **Purple Accent**: `#6B69D6` - Provides visual variety and hierarchy
- **Comprehensive theming** with both dark and light mode variants

#### Key Visual Improvements
- **Gradient site name** with custom typography
- **Transparent widget backgrounds** for a cleaner look
- **Beveled badges** for tags and categories with hover effects
- **Enhanced typography** across all content areas

### Widget and Layout Enhancements
**Today** - Fine-tuning the user experience:

#### Table of Contents Integration
- **Restructured TOC widget** to display icon and title inline
- **Conditional display logic** - right sidebar only shows on posts with content
- **Empty TOC detection** - automatically hides sidebar when no content

```scss
// Hide right sidebar when TOC is empty
.sidebar.right-sidebar.sticky:has(#TableOfContents:empty) {
    display: none !important;
}
```

#### Smart Widget Hiding
- **Archive widget logic** - selectively hide based on child elements
- **Content-aware display** - widgets only appear when they have content to show

```scss
// Hide Archives widget only when it contains specific content
.widget.archives:has(.widget-archive--list) {
    display: none !important;
}
```

### Projects Section Redesign
The homepage Projects widget received a complete makeover:

**Before:**
```
[Stats] [Project Name (centered)] [GitHub Icon]
```

**After:**  
```
[Project Name (left-aligned)] [Stats (right-aligned)]
```

Changes include:
- **Removed GitHub icons** to reduce visual clutter
- **Swapped column positions** for better hierarchy
- **Left-aligned text** for improved readability
- **Maintained functionality** - links and stats remain accessible

### Advanced Features

#### Wide Mode Implementation
A standout feature allowing distraction-free reading:

- **TypeScript implementation** (`assets/ts/wide-mode.ts`) - 191 lines of functionality
- **Toggle button** integrated into the sidebar
- **Floating close button** with smooth animations
- **Full-width content** expansion
- **Responsive layout** adjustments

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Wide mode activates full-width layout
body.wide-mode .main-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr !important;
    gap: 0 !important;
}
```

#### Custom Layout Templates
- **Enhanced baseof.html** with wide-mode integration
- **Improved single.html** for better post page layout  
- **Custom widget templates** for TOC, categories, and markdown content
- **Responsive grid system** adaptations

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure Evolution
```
