Counter-strike 2 was recently released, but doesn't migrate any of your keybinds or settings from CSGO.

Use this tool to:
- Remove unsupported csgo commands (throws errors in cs2 console)
- Update command names, ex: voice_enable >> sv_voiceenable
- Update keybind names, ex: kp_ins >> kp_0
- Update keybind values, ex: +speed >> +sprint

Most of the CS2 and CSGO command mappings (...if there are more) are undocumented and the ones this tool references are based on community feedback.
